# Episode 1: The Vibe Coding Revolution - Production Guide

## Overview
- **Duration:** ~22 minutes
- **Format:** 4K 30fps
- **Style:** Sleek tech-forward + high-energy social media aesthetic
- **Avoid:** Cheesy corporate stock (staged office smiles, pristine everything)

---

## B-ROLL STRATEGY: AI-Generated vs Artlist

### When to Use AI-Generated (Veo 3.1 / Nano Banana)
- **Abstract/conceptual visuals** (data flowing, neural networks, code visualization)
- **Sci-fi tech aesthetics** (futuristic interfaces, holographic displays)
- **Metaphorical imagery** (transformation, revolution, growth)
- **Things that don't exist** (your specific vision that stock can't provide)

### When to Use Artlist
- **Real-world footage** (data centers, people coding, landscapes, indigenous communities)
- **Drone shots** (nature, cities, infrastructure)
- **Authentic human moments** (diverse builders, real workspaces)
- **Documentary-style footage** (environmental shots, mining, water systems)

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Use Artlist for grounding/reality, AI-gen for visual metaphors and transitions.

## AI VIDEO GENERATION PROMPTS (Veo 3.1)

### Abstract/Conceptual:

**Data Flow / Neural Network:**
```
Cinematic shot of glowing data streams flowing through a dark void, blue and purple light trails forming neural network patterns, 4K, futuristic aesthetic, slight camera movement tracking the flow, no text
```

**Transformation/Revolution:**
```
Abstract visualization of transformation, particles of light reorganizing from chaos into ordered beautiful patterns, representing paradigm shift, dark background with vibrant accent colors, cinematic quality
```

**Profit vs Purpose Visual:**
```
Split composition: left side cold blue corporate grid patterns converging to a central point, right side warm organic golden light expanding outward like roots or mycelium, visual metaphor for extraction vs regeneration
```

**AI Amplification:**
```
A single point of light that pulses and creates expanding concentric waves of energy, each wave becoming more complex and beautiful, representing ideas being amplified, cinematic lighting
```

**Design Failure / System Breaking:**
```
Abstract geometric structure (like a complex network or building) slowly revealing cracks and fragments falling away, not violent but revealing underlying fragility, moody lighting
```

**New Beginning / Revolution:**
```
Dawn breaking over a digital landscape, first light touching geometric forms that begin to glow and transform, sense of new era beginning, cinematic sweep, hopeful tone
```

**Values Visualization:**
```
Abstract: human heartbeat rhythm transforming into flowing lines of code, warm organic reds transitioning to cool tech blues while maintaining the organic pulse pattern
```

### More Literal/Grounded:

**Builder at Work (stylized):**
```
Close-up hands typing on a mechanical keyboard, soft cinematic lighting, slight lens flare, code reflections visible in glasses or screen, intimate creative moment
```
